LATTICE

lattice is an interface to the shared library latco, which calculates
the zeroth lattice cohomology of a singularity and the root, as well as
Euler characteristics, and gives a bound for the rank of the minimal
path lattice cohomology. It uses László's reduction theorem to reduce to
a smaller dimensional case. Unfortunately, such a theorem has not been
proved for the minimal path lattice cohomology, hence the bound.

INSTALL

First install latco, available at

https://github.com/baldursigurds/latco

Then, download the sources to lattice, and run 

make
sudo make install

The files data1, data2 and data3, distributed with the software, provide
the necessary data for one topological type each. The program can also
be run without arguments for manual input. For further information on
how to enter and run data, consult the manual lattice(1), which is also
available online:
