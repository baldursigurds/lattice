LATTICE

This is a program which calculates the zeroeth lattice cohomology of a
singularity and the root, as well as the rank of the minimal path cohomology.
It uses Tamás' reduction theorem to reduce to a smaller dimensional case. After
that, it's a simple width first search algorithm to locate components.
